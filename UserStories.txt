Humane Society User Stories
Project out of 105 points

As a developer, I want to contribute to the backend of an application for a humane society that stores and displays 
data about dogs, cats, and other animals in a database (created using the provided ‘HumaneSociety_DBCreation.sql’file).

The ‘Query.cs’ file contains many methods that currently throw the ‘NotImplementedException’. 

The primary goal of this project is to implement these functions.
